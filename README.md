This program is a study in animation, specifically particle generation, and it uses sine and cosin to provide the particles with motion. 

To internact with the program, use the GUI sliders in the top left corner of the canvas. The top slider changes the force at which the particles are projected and the bottom slider changes the color of the particles.
